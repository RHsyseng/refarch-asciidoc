== Questions and Concerns About using Asciidoc

=== _Asciidoctor.org_
Read as many of these as time allows. This will greatly increase efficiency while writing asciidocs. 

* http://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor.org]
* http://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc[AsciiDoc cheatsheet]
* http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/userguide.html[Asciidoc Userguide]

=== _How to install Asciidoctor_

Asciidoctor works on Linux, OSX (Mac) and Windows and requires one of the following implementations of Ruby:

* MRI (Ruby 1.8.7, 1.9.3, 2.0.0 & 2.1.2)
* JRuby 1.7 (Ruby 1.8 and 1.9 modes)
* Rubinius 2.2.x
* Opal (JavaScript)

There are several methods to install Asciidoctor as documented within https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor[GitHub's AsciiDoctor], however, the steps below are how I installed it. I use asciidoctor for creation of HTML docs. 

With a terminal window, execute the following command

[source,shell]
$ gem install asciidoctor

NOTE: If you have an earlier version of Asciidoctor installed, you can update it using:

[source,shell]
$ gem update asciidoctor

NOTE: Within Fedora 18 or greater, you can install asciidoctor using `yum` however, I did not chose this route as on Fedora 20 the version is 0.1.4 and the latest version is 1.5.2

<<<

Once Asciidoctor gem installed successfully the asciidoctor command line interface (CLI) willb e available on your PATH. To verify it is available, run the following command:

[source,shell]
$ asciidoctor --version

The info provided is the asciidoctor version and ruby environment version

[source,shell]

=== _How to install Asciidoctor-PDF_

To install asciidoctor-pdf (alpha software) follow the steps below.

My preferred method to install asciidoctor-pdf is to use RVM. `RVM` allows one to have separate _workspaces_ called _gemsets_ that key each Ruby environment completely isolated from another. It also doesn't require root access. The nice part of this since asciidoctor-pdf is still alpha, it allows me to keep different versions in different workspaces making it easier to test between dev, latest alpha and alpha-1 versions.

With a terminal window, execute the following command to setup an RVM environment. For more info on RVM, visit https://rvm.io

. Import the key of the RVM team which will be used to validate archives:
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
$ *gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3*
----
+
. Next, install the RVM script in your home directory (resides in $HOME/.rvm):
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
$ *\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable*
----
+
. Source your bash profile
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
$ *source ~/.bash_profile*
----
+
<<<

+
. Install at least one version of Ruby, version 2.2 is the one used.
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
$ *rvm install 2.2*
----
+
. Finally, you'll be ready to start creating gemsets (aka workspaces). Here's how you create and switch to a new gemset:
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
$ *rvm use 2.2@asciidoctor-pdf-dev --create*
----
+
NOTE: After the gemset is created, the `--create flag` is not required. Each time you call `rvm use`, it will switch to an isolated workspace.

+

. Once the development asciidoctor-pdf-dev workspace is created, git clone the repository to get the latest version.
. Confirm the rvm workspace is using asciidoctor-pdf-dev via:
+

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ *rvm current*
ruby-2.2.1@asciidoctor-pdf-dev
----
+
. Git clone the asciidoctor-pdf-dev repository
+

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ *git clone https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf*
----
+
. Install bundler using gem
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
$ *gem install bundler*
----
+

. Change directory into asciidoctor-pdf-dev directory.
+

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ *cd /path/to/asciidoctor-pdf-dev*
----
+
. Use `bundle` command to install dependences
+

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ *bundle*
----
+
<<<

+
. Install the syntax highlight source listings.
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
$ *gem install coderay*
$ *gem install rouge*
$ *gem install pygments.rb*
----
+

. Confirm the required gems install properly, and verify the `asciidoctor-pdf` version
+

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ */path/to/asciidoctor-pdf/bin/asciidoctor-df -v*
Asciidoctor PDF 1.5.0.dev using Asciidoctor 1.5.2 [http://asciidoctor.org]
Runtime Environment (ruby 2.2.1p85 (2015-02-26 revision 49769) [x86_64-linux]) (lc:UTF-8 fs:UTF-8 in:- ex:UTF-8)
----
+
. This completes the steps to create and have the latest dev version of asciidoctor-pdf-dev. The next steps are to install a new workspace that has the latest alpha/beta stable release.

. Once the development asciidoctor-pdf-dev workspace is created, go ahead and create the latest alpha version workspace.
+

NOTE: Latest version at the time of this writing is alpha9

+
[subs=+quotes]
----
$ *rvm use 2.2@asciidoctor-pdf-alpha9 --create*
----
+
. Confirm rvm version
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
$ *rvm current*
ruby-2.2.1@asciidoctor-pdf-alpha9
----
+

. Install asciidoctor-pdf
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
$ *gem install --pre asciidoctor-pdf*
----
+
. Install the syntax highlight source listings.
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
$ *gem install coderay*
$ *gem install rouge*
$ *gem install pygments.rb*
----
+
NOTE: If you have an issue installing _pygments.rb_, it is probably due to requiring `ruby-devel` package.
+
. Verify install of asciidoctor-pdf-alpha via
+

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ *asciidoctor-pdf -v*

=== _Convert Asciidoc to PDF_ 

To convert your asciidoc to pdf, using ruby. Follow the steps below.

. `cd` into the /path/to/asciidoctor-pdf/ , example below.
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
$ **/HOMEDIR/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.1@asciidoctor-pdf-alpha9/gems/asciidoctor-pdf-1.5.0.alpha.9/data/themes**
----
+
. Get the latest copy of the refarch template and place it in the data/themes directory of your specified rvm workspace
+

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ **wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/rlopez133/600279abdc7d05ad91f4/raw/d86523c41885522868d9f4303557df8fe94fbdd1/asciidoctor-theme.yml**
----
+

NOTE: Within the theme file, you must fix the appropriate locations for your images.

+

. Create a pdf from the asciidoc file.
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
$ **./bin/asciidoctor-pdf -a pdf-style=asciidoctor <name>.adoc**
----

This will place a <name>.pdf into your current directory. 



== Style Guide 
* System names should be short functional names.
* Avoid long references if possible – folder names, urls, filenames.

=== _Good References_

* Red Hat – WordUsage
** https://home.corp.redhat.com/node/67041
* Grammar style guide
** https://home.corp.redhat.com/wiki/red-hat-style-guide
* Grammar Questions
** http://www.drgrammar.org/frequently-asked-questions

=== _Things to Avoid_

* Words
** we
** us
** I
** will
** you
** Two spaces next to each other
** Misspellings
* Single item lists or sub-sections
** This is a perfect example of what not to do
* Tense
** Try not to write in past tense (e.g. did)
** Try not to write in future tense (e.g. will)
** Write in present tense.
* Inconsistency
** Be consistent with the writing. Don't change from one style to another during the paper.
** Ensure all items in a list end with a period or do not
** Headings are similar. 
*** Do:	Writing, Reading, Erasing
*** Don't:	Writing, How to read, Erasing
** Tables are the same width on all pages.
* Formatting
** Never manually format by using inserted newlines or inserting page breaks
** Instead, use “Format” menu and adjust items in this way
** If the change is something that applies to everything in the document (e.g. All heading level 2 items should start on a new page), edit the style instead (better yet, change this in the template).
* Cross-References
** Only use a cross-reference when the object to be referenced is not directly below or above the reference
** See https://home.corp.redhat.com/node/49989

=== _Entity Callouts_

An __entity__ is basically a word or set of words that are not normal English terms that need to be called out in some manner.  When using these words in normal paragraphs, they need to be called out with something like *bold*, _italics_, “quotes”, or a different ++font++. The point is to ensure that the reader is aware that these terms are special, and not to be confused with a normal English word. A simple example would be a sentence as such:

====
When a node is detected to be not communicating with the cluster it needs to be fenced by fenced.
====

Without a callout of some kind, this could be confusing. However, with the command fenced in a different style it makes more sense:

.Bold a word syntax
----
When a node is detected to be not communicating with the cluster it needs to be fenced by *fenced*.
----

====
When a node is detected to be not communicating with the cluster it needs to be fenced by *fenced*.
====

=== _Character Styles_

These styles only apply to a word or a set of characters. 

==== _Files_

File names should appear in italics if in a paragraph.

.Italizes a file name syntax
[source,asciidoc]
The _/etc/resolv.conf_ file configures name lookup settings.

.Result
====
The _/etc/resolv.conf_ file configures name lookup settings.
====

==== _Software Name_
Callout a command, package name, channel name, project names, products, etc. 

.Software Callout Syntax
[source,asciidoc]
`*CloudForms*` is composed of `*Aeolus Conductor*`, `*Application Engine*`, `*deltacloud*`, and many others.

Result: callout syntax showing in bold monospace font.
====
`*CloudForms*` is composed of `*Aeolus Conductor*`, `*Application Engine*`, `*deltacloudd*`, and many others.
====

==== _UI Element_

Use when something needs to be clicked on a UI, selections need to be chosen, radio boxes, check boxes, input field names, etc.

.Button Macro Syntax
[source,asciidoc]
Press the btn:[OK] button when you are finished.
Select a file in the file navigator and click btn:[Open].

.Result: macros displaying UI buttons
====
Press the btn:[OK] button when you are finished.
Select a file in the file navigator and click btn:[Open].
====



==== _Important Term_
When defining a word, make the word(s) italized, and mono space.

.Important Term Syntax
[source,asciidoc]
`_DM Multipath_` - Provides multipathing ...

====
`_DM Multipath_` - Provides multipathing ...
====

==== _Variable Data_
User input that changes based on the circumstance.

[source,asciicode]
Connect to the server via *_ssh username@domain.name_*

====
Connect to the server via *_ssh username@domain.name_*
====

==== _Generic Entity_
When none of these character styles apply but something needs to be called out, use _italics_.

=== Paragraph Styles
These styles apply to the entire paragraph.

==== _Code_

File contents are highlighted using a background color and `monospace font`.

* Command prompts should be simple, +#+ for root, +$+ for users
* Command prompts should *not* be bolded.
* Commands should be *bolded.*
* Show the commands in a way that the reader can cut and paste them.
* Use long command line options instead of the single character options if possible.

== Figures
Should be consistent.
If you use cross references for some figures, use them for all figures.
Figures should not be the first item on a page.
Use *inkscape* to create the figures in `Scalable Vector Graphics` format. This makes it easy to re-size the image as needed without losing quality. 
It also allows easy sharing of images among the teams. Export the image as a png once it is ready and include it in the document.

== Admonition
There are certain statements that you may want to draw attention to by taking them out of the content’s flow and labeling them with a priority. These are called admonitions. It’s rendered style is determined by the assigned label (i.e., value). Asciidoctor provides five admonition style labels:

* NOTE
* TIP
* IMPORTANT
* CAUTION
* WARNING

When you want to call attention to a single paragraph, start the first line of the paragraph with the label you want to use. The label must be uppercase and followed by a colon (:).
